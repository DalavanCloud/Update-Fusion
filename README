This code is a workaround to allow data in a spreadsheet to update a fusion table.  In order to do this the code deletes all the data that was previously in the fusion table then sends all of the data currently in the spreadsheet to the fusion table.  With the newest version it has the capability to take data from multiple sheets and send it across.  These ranges must have the same number of columns as each other but don't necessarily have to have the same column names.  The first range must have column names that match the fusion table exactly.  For all the rest the header row is not used when the query is being generated.  Each spreadsheet saves its own range called fusion and then the name of the spreadsheet without any spaces it it.
